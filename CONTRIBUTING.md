# Contributing to Project Tools

Hi and thanks for taking the time to read these guidelines for contributing to Project Tools.

I really hope you can help with any aspect of the project, since I've been learning on-the-fly and would really appreciate any useful positive feedback as to how the process, code or documentation could be improved.


## Bugs / Feature Requests / ToDos
Please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/derrickr/project-tools/issues) for any bugs, feature requests or ToDos.

Be sure to include a title, clear description and as much relevant information as possible, along with a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.


## Submitting changes
It'd be great if you'd submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/derrickr/project-tools/pulls) to inform others about your changes.

Please ensure that clear log messages are always used for your commits:

    $ git commit -m "Adding Contributing Guidelines to Project Tools"


## Get in touch
It'd be great to hear from you, so please do get in touch by sending an email to [support@project-tools.co.uk](support@project-tools.co.uk)
